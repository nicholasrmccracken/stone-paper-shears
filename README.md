## Iteration 1: Console Edition
The rock paper scissors framework was implemented directly in the console using only JavaScript to practice basic JS syntax and functions.

## Iteration 2: Adding Frontend UI
A front-end UI using HTML and CSS was constructed to support clickable buttons in the form of Minecraft item images, as well as health bars for the user and computer, and a game-over screen dependent on whether the user won or lost in a best of nine games.

### Learned:
- Implemented custom font pack using CSS
- Basics of DOM manipulation via JavaScript functions
- Expanded knowledge of JavaScript file organization, scopes, calling, invoking, events, etc
